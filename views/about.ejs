        <p class="site-lead">
          Founded at a chalk-dusted coffee shop after a day of failed top-outs, Big Boulder was dreamed up by
          climbers who wanted a lightweight, focused place to log sends and trade beta without the noise.
          Today, it's where weekend warriors and gym rats alike keep their stoke alive between sessions.
